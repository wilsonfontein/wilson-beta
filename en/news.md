###Who rediscovers the Devilsgorge
Years ago my father found, while stalking, the Devilsgorge. He named it the Devilsgorge because it was simmilar to Devilsgorge in Germany wich he knew from his early days. It is a very narrow four meter deep and ten meter long gorge. At the end of the gorge is a deep round water hole. The gorge is so narrow that only one animal at a time can reach the water and than has to reverse back. Or the animal jumps into the water, turn around and go back out. 

The entrance to the gorge is hidden. Years ago I took friends up to about 20 meters away from the entrance and ask them to show it to me. Nobody found the entrance. 

Now Murphy's Law came into effect. After thirty years I myself cannot find the gorge anymore. I spend a few days with the whole family looking for it, without success. 

That's why I put up a price to whoever rediscovers the gorge. 



1. **Price: one bottle of wine / one six pack beer **
2. **Price: two bottles of wine / two six pack beer** 


If You rediscover the gorge twice, you qualify for both prices.



PS. Wouldn't it be nice to eternalise yourself as rediscoverer here with a picture of the gorge. 

Where is the Devilsgorge more or less?
